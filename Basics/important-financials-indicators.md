Ratios

- The desirable values for the listed metrics vary by industry and market conditions, but generally, investors often look for the following:

1. Current Ratio: A higher ratio (e.g., above 1) indicates a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations. Values above 1.5 are generally considered good, but this can depend heavily on the industry standard.
2. Profit Margin: Higher is generally better, as it indicates more efficiency at turning revenue into profit. A good profit margin will also vary by industry, but a higher percentage is generally more favorable.
3. Return on Assets (ROA): This shows how efficient management is at using its assets to generate profit. Higher percentages are generally better; a ROA above 5% is often considered good, though this can vary by industry.
4. Return on Equity (ROE): A higher ROE indicates efficiency at generating income from shareholder investments. Above 10â€“15% is often considered good, but, again, standards can vary by industry.
5. LT Debt/Equity: A lower ratio is generally better, suggesting less reliance on borrowing relative to equity. Values below 0.5 are often considered good, indicating a financially stable company, but some industries are more capital-intensive and typically operate with higher ratios.
6. P/E Ratio: This varies widely by industry and market conditions, but generally, a lower P/E ratio could indicate undervalued stocks. However, extremely low values may also indicate a lack of investor confidence or underlying problems within the company.
7. P/B Ratio: Similar to the P/E ratio, a lower P/B ratio might suggest that a stock is undervalued, but this can vary by industry and other factors. A P/B ratio under 1 can indicate potential undervaluation, though context is crucial.
8. EPS (ttm): Higher values are generally better, indicating a company's profitability. However, it's important to also consider the context of the industry and the company's growth phase.
