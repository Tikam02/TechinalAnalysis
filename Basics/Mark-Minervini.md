Minervini’s Specific Entry Point Analysis® (SEPA®) is what he has also described as his trading style as “conservative aggressive opportunist”, meaning that he would combine technical and fundamental analysis to enter a position from a very low risk, he would follow his position in order to achieve relatively significant compounding gains, with either long or short direction, and he would close his position very quickly in case that he is wrong.





### Growth Stock Company Categories
Mark Minervini separates companies that seem tradeable to him into four main categories for long positions and two for short positions.

- Long: Market Leaders = Market Leaders are the first to start moving in a bull run, supported by high PE and a near their 52-Week high price, usually small or mid-cap.
- Long: Top Competitors = Top Competitors are the “second best” companies in an industry, after the leader.
- Long: Institutional Favorites = Institutional Favorites are stocks that would fit O’Neil’s “I” in his “CAN SLIM” method.
- Long: Turnaround Situations = The Turnaround Situation Companies are equal to the “N” in O’Neil’s “CAN SLIM” method.
- Short: Cyclicals = Companies that rise and fall according to the market, for both long and short positions.
- Short: Laggards = Shorting opportunities.


### Company Scanning
**Within the categories mentioned above, Mark Minervini looks for stocks according to the following criteria:**

**Technical**
- Price above the 200-day and 150-day averages, with the 150-day moving average being above the 200-day moving average and the 200-day moving average moving upwards for a while.
- Price at least 30% above the 52-week low, and ideally around 25% away from its 52-week high.
- Relative strength greater than 70.
- The price finds itself in the second stage of its cycle (explained below).
- High trading volume, a strong daily price increase, and upward gaps are also indications that the stock has caught the attention of the market.

**Fundamental**
- Similar to O’Neil’s accelerated earnings (EPS), revenues, and profit margins on a quarterly basis.
- At least a 10% rise in sales growth.
- A new product, management, business category or sector, or any other catalyst could drive an uptrend.
- Although the price is moving upward, the PE ratio doesn’t change as much since earnings are also growing.
- Small float, meaning limited supply.

### Key Lessons
**General**

- A great company is not always a great stock, and vice versa.
- Price action reflects market sentiment and expectations. Fundamental analysis, together with financial statement analysis, is subjective, according to Mark Minervini.
- Trading is a marathon, not a sprint. One should plan for the long term.
- Trading is all about discipline, risk management, and finding systems with an edge (winning criteria).
- The best IPOs are the ones that start in bear markets. Not many people pay attention to them, although they are building solid bases.
- One should understand that trading doesn’t mean having an open position all the time an open position, nor being fully invested. In fact, trading is about taking small gains often, because bigger moves do not occur often, but also allowing winners to run, when possible.
- Mark would not go long in a stock, even if everything about it seems bullish, but the overall market is bearish. He would check breadth indicators and various ETFs to check the overall market direction.


### Fundamental Analysis
- Although fundamentals play a fairly big role in Minervini’s pricing, he certainly doesn’t consider himself a value investor, nor does he claim that he knows much about them.
- Minervini mentions again and again that the “value investing mentality” of buying a stock at a cheap price can be fatal to a growth investor. On the contrary, a growth stock trader needs to buy stocks with a high P/E ratio and head for a higher P/E ratio.
- Like William O’Neil, Mark Minervini is looking for acceleration in a company’s earnings per share. The EPS needs to be greater than the previous quarter and be in an uptrend.


### Journaling
- A journal needs to track each position’s entry point, exit point, and the duration that the position remained open. From this data, one can calculate the average gain per trade, the average loss per trade, the risk-to-reward ratio, the frequency of wins (referred to by Minervini as the “batting average”), the adjusted win-to-loss ratio (AWLR) which is calculated together with the batting average (average gain times batting average), and the frequency of losses.

- All the journal data regarding the trades can also be visualized in the form of a distribution. Of course, the skew needs to be towards the winning trades, the losing trades must not have any long tails.
- The main reason to track the duration, in days, for the opened position is to be sure that one “cuts losing trades short, and lets winners run”. If the duration of the losing trades is longer than the duration of the winning trades, it means that one is trying to oppose his or her beliefs to the market, and he or she is not letting the market show what needs to be traded.- 
From a journal, one could not only learn about his or her performance metrics but also value all the trades included against the actual price chart. “Did all the rules followed?” and “could anything be done differently?” are just some of the questions that can be answered through this process. In that sense, replaying each trade can not only help with strategy development and finding an edge but also in the self-improvement of the trader.
