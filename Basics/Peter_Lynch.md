## Peter Lynch 

Peter Lynch classifies stocks into 6 groups:
1. Fast growers. 25%+ earnings growth.
2. Medium growers (stalwarts). Steady 10-12% earnings growth.
3. Slow growers (sluggards). No or very little growth but they often pay generous dividends.
4. Cyclicals. Sales and profits fall and rise in regular but not completely predictable fashion. These do well when economies come out of a recession and begin to expand.
5. Turnarounds. Stocks that go through deep troubles and their survival may come into question. If they manage to fix their issues they can have big rebounds that are the lest correlated to the overall market.
6. Asset plays. Hidden assets.
