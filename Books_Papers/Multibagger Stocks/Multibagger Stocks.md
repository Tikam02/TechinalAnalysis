## Chapter - 2

The Price to earning ratio (PR) ratio is a widely used valuation matrix in the stock market.

PE Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)

In other words - Stock Price = Earnings Per Share (EPS) X PE Ratio

It simply means that the stock price is the function of both EPS and the PE ratio. EPS is calculated as a company's profits divided by the number of shares. Thue, a mere earnings (profit) growth is not sufficient for stock price appreciation.

You can choose any random stocks that generated multifold returns in any year and you will notice the same picture, both earnings and PE ratio expansion is a must for a multibagger stock.

### Lifecycle of a multi bagger stock 

1. Initial Phase
2. Advancement Phase
3. Maturity or declining phase

#### 1. Initial Phase

- Less than 500 crores of market capitalisation
- Low Liquidity 
- Low average trading volume
- No institutional names that is mutual funds, FIIs or DIIs in the company's shareholders list because of low liquidity
- No media coverage, no research papers, the name is not discovered yet
- Valuation remains cheap at this stage, all the traditional valuation metrics, like PE ratio, PB ratio etc. remains low compared with those of company's peers.

#### 2. Advancement Phase

- If a microcap stock quickly enters into the small-cap zone, then we can say it is in the advancement phase and it will most likely graduate to the mid-cap phase also.
- The mid-cap and small-cap phases are the ideal stages for  multibagger discovery for maximum wealth creation.
- The liquidity improves, the average trading volume should be at least more than double that of the initial stage
- Big investors start taking positions in the stock which triggers another round of multifold returns at this stage.
- With entry of institutional investors, media coverage and research reports pouring in. More and more retail investors are now getting attracted to the story.

#### 3. Mature Phase or Declining Phase

Few shares move from the advancement phase to the mature phase, some move into the declining phase.

- High liquidity and trading volumes.
- The stocks enters into frontline index like NIFTY50 or NIFTY500
- High recognition in the market and lots of media attention, research reports and public intrest.
- Significant institutional holdings
- The stock is already traded at a higher valuation. Thus despite earning growth, PR expansion is no longer visible.

**Declining Phase

- Unlike in the mature phase, the business fails to deliver earnings growth, and as a result, the PE ratio starts contracting.
- A combination of declining earnings growth and PR contraction results in an exponential fall in the stock price.
- During it's fall, occassional pullback rallies brings hope, however such pullbacks rallies later prove to be traps.
- One of the most distinctive features of this phase is that, institutional shareholders start reducing their positions in the stock while retail investors increase theirs.

### 1.1 Triggers for multibagger stocks

### Trigger 1: Margin Expansion

Margin expansion is the first and foremost trigger for both earnings and PE ratio growth.
There are two different kinds of margins on financial websites:

1. EBIDTA Marging - It measures how much in earnings(profit) a company has generated before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as a percentage of its revenue. This margin is also referred to as the "operating profit margin"

   EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Revenue
   
2. Net Profit Marging - This measures how much profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. So Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Revenue (Total Sales)

Under ideal circumstances, both margins should run in sync - that is if the EBITDA margin keeps improving then the net profit margin should also improve, and vice-versa EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and and amortization, so if any one of these parameters shows some anomly, then it will reflect on both margins..

If the margin expands from 10 percent to 15 percent over a period of a few years, then the PR ratio must expand and the stock price should follow. This association applies in the case of margin contraction too. Every wealth destroyer has experienced margin contraction over the long term. 

While hunting for multibagger stocks, the criteria for selecting them should follow this order of preferences:
1. Visibility of both EBITDA and net profit margin expansion for the business
2. The business's ability to protect its margins across different economic cycles. In other words, it's profit margin should not experience wild volatility.
3. Visibility of margin contraction is a negative criterion, and such business should be avoided.

Three drivers behind margin expansion and contraction:
1. Pricing power of the business
2. Backward integration
3. Industry tailwinds


**Pricing Power

1. B2B Model : B2B refers to "business to business". A B2B company provides services or products to other businesses. For example, a bottle manufacturer sells bottles to other businesses like liquor companies or pharma companies.
2. B2C Model : B2C refers "business to consumers". A B2C company directly sells services or products to the end customer. For example, liquor manufacturers or drug manufacturers can directly sell their end products to the customers.

B2C companies always remain in an advantageous position when it comes their ability to protect their margins because it is always easier to negotiate with retail customers than with other large businesses. 

The businesses (packaging companies, active pharmaceuticals ingredients etc,) supplying to Abbott are B2B model and have no pricing power. But Abbott itself is in the B2C segment and has a lot of pricing power. Naturally,  you will find a very strong and consistent margin trend.

**Backward Integration

A business that has executed backward integration has presence in the entire value chain of the industry it operates in. 

A pharma company that has a presence only in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) segment is vulnerable to margin pressure because whenever the price of basic chemicals increases because the company has a B2B business model.The company purchases basic chemicals from some other business and then sells APIs to the formulation players.
Both its suppliers and customers are business entities, which means limited negotiation power for the company.

However, a company with presence in the entire value chain enjoys pricing power. When a pharma company has presence in the entire manufacturing chain and also sells its finished goods (medicines) to the end customers, it can then easily pass on any kind of raw materials price hike.

"A fully backward integrated business with a B2C model is the best candidate as a potential multibagger stock"

**Industry Tailwinds

Industry tailwinds are when there is a sudden demands due to some situations and the company has large stocks of the products then they can negoatiate margins. 

"Industry tailwinds" refer to positive trends or favorable conditions that are influencing and benefiting a specific industry. These are external factors that can boost the overall performance and growth of companies operating within that industry. Tailwinds can arise from various sources and circumstances. Some common examples include:

1. **Economic Growth:** A growing economy can lead to increased consumer spending, business investments, and overall demand for goods and services across various industries.
    
2. **Technological Advancements:** Industries can experience tailwinds when new technologies emerge or existing technologies improve, enabling companies to enhance their products, services, and operational efficiency.
    
3. **Demographic Shifts:** Changes in population demographics, such as population growth, aging populations, or shifts in consumer preferences, can create opportunities for certain industries.
    
4. **Regulatory Support:** Favorable regulatory changes or government policies can provide tailwinds by reducing barriers to entry, promoting innovation, or supporting specific industries.
    
5. **Global Trends:** Trends on a global scale, such as globalization, urbanization, or sustainability initiatives, can impact industries positively by opening up new markets or driving demand for specific products or services.
    
6. **Consumer Behavior:** Changes in consumer behavior, preferences, or lifestyle trends can create tailwinds for industries that align with or anticipate these shifts.
    
7. **Environmental Factors:** Increasing awareness of environmental issues and sustainability can drive demand for eco-friendly products and services, benefiting industries that focus on sustainable practices.
    
8. **Access to Capital:** Availability of capital, low-interest rates, or favorable financing conditions can support industry growth by facilitating investments, expansions, and innovation.
    

For investors and businesses, identifying industry tailwinds is crucial for making informed decisions and capitalizing on opportunities. Conversely, "headwinds" refer to negative trends or challenges that may hinder industry performance. Understanding both tailwinds and headwinds is essential for strategic planning and risk management within a specific industry.

Industry tailwinds can't be predicted beforehand; it should not be the sole investment rationale. In the presence of all other multibagger triggers, industry tailwinds accelerate the multibagger returns.


### Trigger 2 : Debt

If the margin expansion is the first and foremost parameter for multibagger returns, then the second most important deciding factor is the debt burden or the quantum of borrowing in the company's books of accounts. In fact the profit margin can expand or contract depending on the debt burden of the company.

External borrowings mean that irrespective of the business cash flows, every month you need to repay something.

While searching for multibaggers, a very important consideration would be the debt burden of the business. For this purpose, we will look at a target company's debt-to-equity ratio. This ratio is calculated by dividing the company's total liablities by its total shareholders funds.

**Companies with a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 0.3

We can safely consider companies as having minimal debt when their debt-to-equity ratio is less than 0.3. Overall, if a company satisfies all other criteria of earnings and PE expansion and has a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 0.3 then it can be a great potential multibagger stock.

**Companies with a debt-to-equity ratio of  0.3 to 1 

The range between 0.3 to 1 is still a fair zone to search for potential multibagger stock. In such cases, we need to make sure that the overall debt level is not increasing year after year.


**Companies with a debt-to-equity ratio of more than 1 

Companies in this category often posses stretched balance sheet and poor cash flows from operations. These companies are the most vulnerable during any economic downturn. Historically, if you notice all the stocks that have cashed by more than 90 percent, you will find that most of them had debt-to-equity ratio of more than 1.

It is safe to ignore this ratio for the banks and financial companies.

### Trigger 3 : Capacity Expansion

Capacity expansion will always trigger revenue expansion but not always margin expansion. Thus, capacity expansion alone is not sufficient for multibagger returns from stocks.

While capacity expansion is on, if the company falls into debt trap, then its stock price will nosedive. The bigger the invetsment in the project, the bigger will be the risk. To be on the safe side, prefer to invest in companies that embark on capacity expansion with minimal capex.

### Trigger 4 : Capitalization of opportunity size

Huge opportunity size a must for multibagger returns. However, opportunity size alone should not be the deciding factor for investment.
Overall, one needs to remember that while huge opportunity size is a must for mutibagger returns, at the end of the day, how a company capitalizes on that opportunity decides its multibagger returns.
